Capstone steps:
-maybe on the portfolio page; generate a new chart everytime you press the chart button


-implement a function that will be put in most routes to ensure the user is logged in
-vizio your routes n stuff
-app.py around 173




-add delete btn for stocks in viewownportfolio.html
-maybe to make app easier just have app calculate the current value of your portfolio
-don't allow duplicate symbols to be added



-add an evt listener to the body or element that is already loaded(may not be neded 
since flask will reload a page with possbly new evt listeners every redirect)
, be sure to remove them later if needed
