Capstone steps:
-maybe on the portfolio page; generate a new chart everytime you press the chart button


-implement a function that will be put in most routes to ensure the user is logged in
-vizio your routes n stuff
-app.py around 173



Make this a stretch goal(make base firstline functionality app first b4 doing this stretch goal)(stretch goal):
-since can only get 5 charts, making do caching of data
-all user requests returned from application 
-heroku might give trouble for background processes, to implement this, so might have to ditch



Implementing sorting for a list to go through people's portfolios.
-done from request through a browser


Create a route when someone clicks X to remove a ticker.

API Issues: 5 requests/min


Todos to implement:



-after a page using route using (ditch for right now)
    -hide the "add ticker" button for 20 seconds so the API doesn't crash, implement in js?
    

- Users view others portfolios without being able to edit (might ditch this goal)
- Change chartjs text colors from grey to something more readible


{{ | length }} template stuff to make length or something for ref

-stocker homepage needs imagery something financial

-put borders on UI
    -use bootstrap seperator classes and borders
        -see email for details
    -use possibly less plots for ticker charts

-the way you access ticker data should be the same whether you fetch data from api or database
    -the way you would do this
