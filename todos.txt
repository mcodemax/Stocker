-since can only get 5 charts, making do caching of data
-all user requests returned from application 
-heroku might give trouble for background processes, to implement this, so might have to ditch

Todos to implement:



-after a page using route using (ditch for right now)
    -hide the "add ticker" button for 20 seconds so the API doesn't crash, implement in js?
